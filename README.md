# photo-metadatacreationtomodify
Simple bash script to copy the original creation date of a photo from exif metadata to the modify time of the photo. Some photo gallery apps display photo order based on the modify time, so this script will ensure the photos are displayed in the order they were taken. 


Requires the installation of the exiftool package. 

TO USE:
Place the script in the same directory of the photos and run the script. The script will go through all the photos in that folder.
